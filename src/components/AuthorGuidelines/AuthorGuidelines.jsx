                            Procedia Computer Science is a product for proposed conference proceedings. It only receives manuscripts submitted to a conference that has an agreement with Elsevier for publication on Procedia Computer Science. Procedia Computer Science is an open access product focusing entirely on publishing high quality proceedings of all topics of Computer Science with the exception of certain workshops in Theoretical Computer Science, as our Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science http://www.elsevier.com/locate/entcs are the primary outlet for these papers. This enables fast dissemination so that conference delegates can publish their papers in a dedicated online issue on ScienceDirect. The journal is covered by Scopus, the largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature.
                            Peer-review is under the responsibility of the conference organizers who according to the international peer-review standards may use single blind, double blind or open peer review. For details specific to the conference peer-review process, please contact the conference organizer or the guest editor of the conference.

                            Authors are expected to consider carefully the list and order of authors before submitting their manuscript and provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission. Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should be made only before the manuscript has been accepted and only if approved by the journal Editor. To request such a change, the Editor must receive the following from the corresponding author: (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation (e-mail, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition, removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes confirmation from the author being added or removed. Only in exceptional circumstances will the Editor consider the addition, deletion or rearrangement of authors after the manuscript has been accepted. While the Editor considers the request, publication of the manuscript will be suspended. If the manuscript has already been published in an online issue, any requests approved by the Editor will result in a corrigendum.

                            This journal encourages you to cite underlying or relevant datasets in your manuscript by citing them in your text and including a data reference in your Reference List. Data references should include the following elements: author name(s), dataset title, data repository, version (where available), year, and global persistent identifier. Add [dataset] immediately before the reference so we can properly identify it as a data reference. The [dataset] identifier will not appear in your published article.

                            You have the option of converting relevant protocols and methods into one or multiple MethodsX articles, a new kind of article that describes the details of customized research methods. Many researchers spend a significant amount of time on developing methods to fit their specific needs or setting, but often without getting credit for this part of their work. MethodsX, an open access journal, now publishes this information in order to make it searchable, peer reviewed, citable and reproducible. Authors are encouraged to submit their MethodsX article as an additional item directly alongside the revised version of their manuscript. If your research article is accepted, your methods article will automatically be transferred over to MethodsX where it will be editorially reviewed. Please note an open access fee is payable for publication in MethodsX. Full details can be found on the MethodsX website. Please use this template to prepare your MethodsX article.

                            The journal encourages authors to create an AudioSlides presentation with their published article. AudioSlides are brief, webinar-style presentations that are shown next to the online article on ScienceDirect. This gives authors the opportunity to summarize their research in their own words and to help readers understand what the paper is about. More information and examples are available. Authors of this journal will automatically receive an invitation e-mail to create an AudioSlides presentation after acceptance of their paper.

                            <h3><strong>iii. Illustrations</strong></h3> 
                        
                            All figures should be numbered with Arabic numerals (1, 2, …). All photographs, schemas, graphs and diagrams are to be referred to as figures.<br />

                            Line drawings should be good quality scans or true electronic output. Low-quality scans are not acceptable. Figures must be embedded into the text and not supplied separately.<br /> <br />
                            Lettering and symbols should be clearly defined either in the caption or in a legend provided as part of the figure. Figures should be placed at the top or bottom of a page wherever possible, as close as possible to the first reference to them in the paper.<br />
                        
                            The figure number and caption should be typed below the illustration in 9pt and left justified.<br />

                            Artwork has no text along the side of it in the main body of the text. However, if two images fit next to each other, these may be placed next to each other to save space. <br />

                            <h3><strong>iv. Equations</strong></h3> 
                        
                            Equations and formulae should be typed in Mathtype, and numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals in parentheses on the right hand side of the page (if referred to explicitly in the text). They should also be separated from the surrounding text by one space.<br />
                            <br />
                            <h3><strong>v. References</strong></h3> 
                        
                            In the text the number of the reference should be given in square brackets. For references with more than two authors, text citations should be shortened to the first name followed by et al., e.g. Jones [1] discovered that...; Recent results from Brown and Carter [2] and Green et al. [3] indicate that (…).<br />

                            Only essential references, which are directly referred to in the text, should be included in the reference list.<br />

                            References must be listed in numerical order at the end of the paper. Do not begin them on a new page unless this is absolutely necessary. They should be prepared according to the sequential numeric system making sure that all material mentioned is generally available to the reader.<br />

                            Journal references should include: author's surname and initials; initials and surnames of remaining authors; article title (where provided); abbreviated journal title (in italics), year of publication, volume number and page numbers. <br />

                            References to books should include: author's surname and initials; surnames and initials of remaining authors; the book title (in italics); the place of publication and the name of the publisher; and year of publication.References to multi-author works should include author.s surname(s) and initials, the chapter title (where provided); "In:" followed by book title (in italics); initials and name(s) of editors(s) in brackets; volume number and pages; the place of publication and name of the publisher, followed by the year of publication. <br />

                            Here is an example of some references listed according to the sequential numeric system: <br /><br />

                            <h3><strong>iv. Equations</strong></h3> 
                            Equations and formulae should be typed in Mathtype, and numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals in parentheses on the right hand side of the page (if referred to explicitly in the text). They should also be separated from the surrounding text by one space.<br />
                            <br />
                            <h3><strong>vi. Footnotes</strong></h3> 
                            Footnotes should be avoided if possible. Necessary footnotes should be denoted in the text by consecutive superscript letters. The footnotes should be typed single spaced, and in smaller type size (8pt), at the foot of the page in which they are mentioned, and separated from the main text by a short line extending at the foot of the column. The .Els-footnote. style is available in the “MS Word Template” for the text of the footnote.<br />
                            <br />
                            <h3><strong>vii. General guidelines for the preparation of your text</strong></h3> 
                        
                            Avoid hyphenation at the end of a line. Symbols denoting vectors and matrices should be indicated in bold type. Scalar variable names should normally be expressed using italics. Weights and measures should be expressed in SI units. All non-standard abbreviations or symbols must be defined when first mentioned, or a glossary provided.<br />
                            Please proofread your paper carefully before submitting as it will appear in the published volume in exactly the same form. You will receive no proofs.<br /><br />
